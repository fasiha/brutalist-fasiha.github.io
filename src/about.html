 <h1>Insight !== Numbers</h1>

  <h2>Colophon</h2>
  <p>The headline for these pages comes from Dr Hamming’s motto, <strong>“The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers”</strong> <a href="http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=893">[SIAM]</a>.</p>

  <p>The type face is Fira Code by Nikita Prokopov <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">[GitHub]</a>. I had not intended to make a brutalist website, but, <code>&lt;$&gt;~~&gt;***</code> dem ligatures!</p>

  <p>These articles and template are written mostly in HTML, plus a very simple escape-hatch (a very primitive version of <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen</a> down to lozenges <code>&#x25ca;</code>) to ClojureScript. A small script combines all these elements.</p>

  <p>A completely ruined version of Tufte CSS <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">[GitHub]</a> is used to style these pages. May I be forgiven.</p>

  After enjoying programming and Unixing for years, I discovered applied math in mid-undergrad and decided it would be harder, and therefore more interesting, than “just” software engineering. After years of grad school (terminal ABD in electrical engineering at Ohio State), then working in the lovely D.C. metro area (for Leidos, then the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab), I revised my views and came back to Ohio to work as a software engineer who happens to know about signal processing and machine learning.</p>

  <p>I sling C, Python, Julia, CUDA, alas Matlab, etc., to crunch numbers. I craft JavaScript, Clojure, and ClojureScript to make webapps.</p>

  <p>When not writing code or applying math, I study the languages and literatures of Japan, China, Persia, Iceland, and many of this world’s peoples.</p>
